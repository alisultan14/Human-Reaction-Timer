In order for student-athletes to give their best performance out on the field, it is essential that they are alert and ready before the start of the league and other fixtures. Therefore, the college has developed hardware features of the Nexys A7 FPGA board. These include the switches, the LED lamp, and the 7 segment display. Every single module code is written in the System Verilog programming language through the Vivado software suite. The Vivado software suite is also used to create simulations of the modules before combining them and implementing them finally on the Nexys A7 board through a bitstream.
